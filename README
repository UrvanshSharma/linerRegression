📈 Student Marks Prediction — Linear Regression (ML Project)
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a simple Machine Learning workflow using Linear Regression to predict student marks based on the number of hours studied. It covers data preparation, model training, evaluation, prediction, and visualization using Python and Scikit-learn.

The goal is to show a complete beginner-friendly ML pipeline in a clean and reproducible way.

🧠 Problem Statement

Predict a student’s exam marks using the number of study hours with a regression model.

🛠 Tech Stack

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

📂 Dataset

A small structured dataset with two variables:

Hours Studied	Marks
1–10	35–95

This keeps the focus on the ML workflow rather than data cleaning complexity.

⚙️ Workflow

Create dataset using Pandas

Split features and target

Train–test split

Train Linear Regression model

Generate predictions

Evaluate model performance

Visualize regression trend

Predict marks for new study hours

📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

The model reports:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R² Score

Regression slope and intercept

Final regression equation

Example model form:

Marks = m × Hours + b

📈 Visualization

The project generates a styled scatter plot with:

Actual data points

Regression trend line

Grid and labels

High-resolution saved output

▶️ How to Run
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
python linearregression.py

🔍 Example Prediction

The model can estimate marks for new input values:

Input: 7.5 study hours
Output: Predicted marks ≈ ~80

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Understand regression basics

Use train/test split correctly

Evaluate model accuracy

Visualize ML results

Interpret regression coefficients

Structure a small ML project properly

🚀 Future Improvements

Add more features (attendance, assignments, sleep hours)

Use larger real-world dataset

Compare multiple regression models

Add cross-validation

Build a small prediction web app
